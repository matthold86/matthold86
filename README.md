# Hi there 👋
## 🕺 About Me

I'm a data scientist with a curiosity for machine learning, cloud computing, and a hint of backend web development. Sometimes I have an idea and think "Could I build that?". These are the ideas that made it past the first screening process. 

## 🔭 Current Projects
- Building a [homography matrix prediction model](https://github.com/Duke-Basketball-Analytics/homography-deep-learning-model) (part of a larger project for tracking basketball player locations from game footage) 🏀
- Building an [AI Classroom Assistant](https://github.com/matthold86/AI.ClassroomAssistant) for empowering teachers to integrate AI in the classroom ✏️

## 🌱 Learning Goals
- Mastering FastAPI for async programming
- AWS Solutions Architect Certification ETA April 2025!

## 🎯 **Free Time**
- I love running, playing tennis and basketball, and meal prepping 🍳🏃
- Big fan of sci-fi and fantasy novels 📚✨
