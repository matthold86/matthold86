# Hi there 👋
## 🕺 About Me

I'm a data scientist with a curiosity for machine learning, cloud computing, and a hint of backend web development. Sometimes I have an idea and think "Could I build that?". Here you'll find the ideas that made it past the first screening process.

- Building an [AI Classroom Assistant](https://github.com/matthold86/AI.ClassroomAssistant) for empowering teachers to integrate AI in the classroom ✏️

## 🌱 Learning Goals

- AWS Solutions Architect Certification ETA April 2025!

## 🎯 **Free Time**
